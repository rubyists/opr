# Opr

This gem supplies the `opr` binary, which wraps the 1password `op` cli from https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/.
The goal of opr is to be as compatible as possible with the `pass` cli from https://www.passwordstore.org/.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'opr'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install opr

## Usage

- `opr --help`
- `opr list vaults` List all vaults
- `opr list items --vault=SomeVault` List all items in SomeVault
- `opr get SomeVault/SomeItem` Get the password from SomeVault named SomeItem. This should be piped to xclip/pbcopy.
- `opr gen` Generate a new password (8-16 characters)
- `echo "\#@%!" | opr gen` Generate a new password, using only "#@%!" as "special" characters.
- `opr gen -s15` Generate a new password, 15 chars long

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
